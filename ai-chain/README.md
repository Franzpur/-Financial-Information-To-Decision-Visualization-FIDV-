# AI Industry Chain Cube

Modular 3D industry-chain explorer backed by SQLite.

**Concepts (ZH/EN):** see [`CONCEPTS.md`](./CONCEPTS.md) before changing camera, axes, pull, or focus UX. Code tags look like `[C-SLICE]`, `[C-STDVIEW]`.

## Layout

```
ai-chain/
  data/           layers.json, companies.json, ai_chain.db
  server/         db.py (schema + queries), app.py (HTTP API + static)
  CONCEPTS.md     bilingual concept target library (agent continuity)
  web/            index.html, css/, js/ (api, state, scene, ui, main)
  scripts/seed.py refresh DB from JSON
  Open-AI-Chain.command
```

## Run

```bash
./Open-AI-Chain.command
# or
python3 scripts/seed.py && python3 server/app.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8787/ — **engineering homepage** (BICS L1). Decision cube: http://127.0.0.1:8787/cube

While the `.command` launcher is running, type `quit` + Enter (or Ctrl+C) to stop the server.

Finder icons for the launchers live in `assets/fidv-launcher.icns`. After a fresh clone, re-apply with:

```bash
./scripts/set-command-icon.sh
```

## API

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `GET /api/health` | Liveness |
| `GET /api/meta` | Title + country labels |
| `GET /api/layers` | Slices + company counts |
| `GET /api/companies` | `?layer=&country=us\|intl&supply=1&q=` |
| `GET /api/companies/:id` | One company (ring-normalized) |
| `GET /api/bics/l1` | BICS level-1 sectors (C-COORD-3) for homepage |
| `GET /api/bundle` | Bootstrap payload for the cube SPA |

Ring positions (`revScore`, `ring`, `ringCos`, `ringSin`) are computed server-side so the browser never embeds the company table. The 3D space itself is user coordinates `(s, x, y)` — see `web/js/coords.js`. Edit `LAYOUT` (or an object's coord) to move something; do not place scene objects with raw Three.js coordinates.

## Legacy

The previous single-file page is kept as `../ai-chain-cube.html` and backups `../ai-chain-cube.backup-*.html`. Prefer this package going forward.
